title: "Call for Papers"
---
We invite submissions from a broad range of topics that investigate the formal safety of robots while dealing with uncertainties introduced when the robot dynamics are learned or the environment state is estimated. We provide a non-exhaustive list of topics that might be of interest to the target audience for this workshop:

* Control-theoretic techniques for safe task execution, including control barrier functions, reachability analysis, model predictive control, reference governor control, contraction theory.
* Machine learning techniques for safe task execution, including model-based reinforcement learning, robot dynamics model learning and system identification, learning 3-D environment shape and dynamics.

Priority will be given to papers that bridge the gap between the two areas to provide safety and stability guarantees for systems with learned motion and environment dynamics.
