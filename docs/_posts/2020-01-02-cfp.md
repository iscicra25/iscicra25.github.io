We invite submissions from a broad range of topics that investigate the formal safety of robots while dealing with uncertainties introduced when the uncertain robot-dynamics are learned or the environment state is estimated. We provide a non-exhaustive list of topics that might be of interest to the target audience for this workshop:

1. Control-theoretic techniques for safe task execution
   1. Control Barrier Function
   2. Reachability Analysis
   3. Model Predictive Control
   4. Reference Governor Control
   5. Contraction Theory
2. Machine learning techniques (with or without control-theoretic guarantees) for safe task execution
   1. Dynamics model learning or system identification
   2. Learning for collision avoidance
   3. Mapping dynamic environments
3. ML techniques with control-theoretic guarantees
   1. Gaussian process dynamics models for safe control
   2. Neural networks/SVM for environment models used for safe control
   3. Safe Reinforcement Learning
