## Titles and Abstracts for the talks

### Prof Dimitra Panagou' talk (7:00 AM PST)

**Title**: Control synthesis for safety- and time-critical systems under uncertainty

**Abstract**: Fully autonomous operation of robots in unstructured and unknown environments has been an ongoing area of research. Despite significant progress over the years, there are still open challenges due to constraints (e.g., safety and time specifications, computational power), malicious or faulty information, and environmental uncertainty. This talk will present some of our recent results and ongoing work on spatiotemporal control under constraints and uncertainty. The proposed framework on Control Barrier Functions and Fixed-Time Control Lyapunov Functions aims to develop and integrate estimation, learning and control methods towards provably-correct and computationally-efficient mission synthesis for constrained and uncertain multi-agent systems.


### Kelsey Allen's talk (7:30 AM PST)

**Title**: Safety through structured learning in physical problem-solving environments

**Abstract**: The world is structured in countless ways. When cognitive and machine models respect these structures, by factorizing their modules and parameters, they often behave in ways we can better understand and more safely interact with. In this talk, I will discuss our work investigating the factorizations of objects, relations and constraints to create safer, more interpretable artificial agents. Focusing on the domain of physical problem-solving (including construction and tool use), I will show how to harness object and relational structure in the form of graph networks to improve agent generalization, and how to use and learn constraints to enable a simulated robot to solve cognitively inspired tool use problems. By taking better advantage of problem structure, and combining it with general-purpose methods for statistical learning, we can develop more robust and interpretable machine agents that better reflect human expectations.

### Prof Sergey Levine's talk (9:30 AM PST)

**Title**: Safety in Numbers: How Large Prior Datasets Can Put RL into the Real World

**Abstract**: Reinforcement learning provides a general and powerful toolkit for learning-based control. However, conventionally, RL algorithms require training through trial and error, which leaves us with two unenviable choices in the real world: either rely on simulation to provide training, or else risk deploying untrained or partly trained policies, which can fail catastrophically before they improve enough to be reliable. In this talk, I will discuss how reformulating the reinforcement learning problem to focus on data rather than online experience can help to alleviate this challenge: by leveraging the framework of offline RL, we can train policies using previously collected data, and then only deploy policies that have already reached some desired level of performance. I will discuss how we can derive principled offline RL algorithms that learn lower bounds on the true return for the task, and then talk about how such tools can be leveraged to train conservative safety critics, which can further provide constraints on the online training process.


### Prof Melanie Zeilinger's talk (12:30 PM PST)

**Title**: Safe learning-based control using a Model Predictive Control framework

**Abstract**: Model predictive control (MPC) is an established technique for addressing constraint satisfaction with demonstrated success in various industries. However, it requires a sufficiently descriptive system model as well as a suitable formulation of the control objective to provide the desired guarantees and solve the problem via numerical optimization. In this talk, I will present different options how learning and MPC can be combined to overcome some of the individual difficulties of both MPC and available reinforcement learning methods. I will in particular discuss learning for inferring a parametric model of the system dynamics, or for designing the objective in MPC, as well as the use of MPC as a safety filter, providing a modular approach for augmenting high-performance learning-based controllers with constraint satisfaction properties.
