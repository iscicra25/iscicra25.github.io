## Titles and Abstracts for the talks

### Prof Dimitra Panagou' talk (7:00 AM PST)

**Title**: Control synthesis for safety- and time-critical systems under uncertainty

**Abstract**: Fully autonomous operation of robots in unstructured and unknown environments has been an ongoing area of research. Despite significant progress over the years, there are still open challenges due to constraints (e.g., safety and time specifications, computational power), malicious or faulty information, and environmental uncertainty. This talk will present some of our recent results and ongoing work on spatiotemporal control under constraints and uncertainty. The proposed framework on Control Barrier Functions and Fixed-Time Control Lyapunov Functions aims to develop and integrate estimation, learning and control methods towards provably-correct and computationally-efficient mission synthesis for constrained and uncertain multi-agent systems.


### Dr Kelsey Allen's talk (7:30 AM PST)

**Title**: Safety through structured learning in physical problem-solving environments

**Abstract**: The world is structured in countless ways. When cognitive and machine models respect these structures, by factorizing their modules and parameters, they often behave in ways we can better understand and more safely interact with. In this talk, I will discuss our work investigating the factorizations of objects, relations and constraints to create safer, more interpretable artificial agents. Focusing on the domain of physical problem-solving (including construction and tool use), I will show how to harness object and relational structure in the form of graph networks to improve agent generalization, and how to use and learn constraints to enable a simulated robot to solve cognitively inspired tool use problems. By taking better advantage of problem structure, and combining it with general-purpose methods for statistical learning, we can develop more robust and interpretable machine agents that better reflect human expectations.

### Prof Sergey Levine's talk (9:30 AM PST)

**Title**: Safety in Numbers: How Large Prior Datasets Can Put RL into the Real World

**Abstract**: Reinforcement learning provides a general and powerful toolkit for learning-based control. However, conventionally, RL algorithms require training through trial and error, which leaves us with two unenviable choices in the real world: either rely on simulation to provide training, or else risk deploying untrained or partly trained policies, which can fail catastrophically before they improve enough to be reliable. In this talk, I will discuss how reformulating the reinforcement learning problem to focus on data rather than online experience can help to alleviate this challenge: by leveraging the framework of offline RL, we can train policies using previously collected data, and then only deploy policies that have already reached some desired level of performance. I will discuss how we can derive principled offline RL algorithms that learn lower bounds on the true return for the task, and then talk about how such tools can be leveraged to train conservative safety critics, which can further provide constraints on the online training process.

**Title**: Safe Learning-based Control for Robot Autonomy

**Abstract**: In this talk I will provide an overview of recent efforts from my group on infusing safety assurances in robot autonomy stacks equipped with learning-based components, with an emphasis on settings where an autonomous robot needs to interact with a human or operate in complex, possibly previously unseen environments. The underlying approach entails adding structure within robot learning via control-theoretical methods. The discussion will be grounded in a number of practical applications, from self-driving cars to space robots.

### Prof Rose Yu's talk (12:00 PM PST)

**Title**: Incorporating Symmetry for Improved Deep Dynamics Learning

**Abstract**: While deep learning has been used for dynamics learning, limited physical accuracy and an inability to generalize under distributional shift limit its applicability to real-world robots. In this talk, I will demonstrate how to incorporate symmetries into deep neural networks and significantly improve the physical consistency, sample efficiency, and generalization in learning dynamics.  I will showcase the applications of these models to challenging problems such as turbulence forecasting and trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles.


### Prof Melanie Zeilinger's talk (12:30 PM PST)

**Title**: Safe learning-based control using a Model Predictive Control framework

**Abstract**: Model predictive control (MPC) is an established technique for addressing constraint satisfaction with demonstrated success in various industries. However, it requires a sufficiently descriptive system model as well as a suitable formulation of the control objective to provide the desired guarantees and solve the problem via numerical optimization. In this talk, I will present different options how learning and MPC can be combined to overcome some of the individual difficulties of both MPC and available reinforcement learning methods. I will in particular discuss learning for inferring a parametric model of the system dynamics, or for designing the objective in MPC, as well as the use of MPC as a safety filter, providing a modular approach for augmenting high-performance learning-based controllers with constraint satisfaction properties. 

### Prof Claire Tomlin's talk (2:00 PM PST)

**Title**: Safe Learning in Robotics

**Abstract**: In many applications of autonomy in robotics, guarantees that constraints are satisfied throughout the learning process are paramount. We present a controller synthesis technique based on the computation of reachable sets, using optimal control and game theory.  Then, we present methods for combining reachability with learning-based methods, to enable performance improvement while maintaining safety and to move towards safe robot control with learned models of the dynamics and the environment. We will illustrate these “safe learning” methods on robotic platforms at Berkeley, including demonstrations of motion planning around people, and navigating in a priori unknown environments.  

### Prof Aaron Ames's talk (2:30 PM PST)

**Title**: Learning for Safety-Critical Control

**Abstract**: Safety is critical on a wide variety of dynamic robotic systems.  Yet, when deploying controllers that have guarantees of safety on these systems, uncertainties in the model and environment can violate these guarantees in practice.    This talk will approach safety-critical control from the perspective of control barrier functions (CBFs)----describing the basic theory and existing applications of this optimization-based control methodology.  To enable guarantees on CBF controllers realized in practice, we will present an approach that fuses learning with CBFs.  Experimental results on robotic systems will be used to illustrate the approach.  We will also highlight the application of learning to legged robots and robotic assistive devices aimed at restoring mobility.
