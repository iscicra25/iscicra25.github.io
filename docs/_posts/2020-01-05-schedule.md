## Titles and Abstracts for the talks

### Prof Dimitra Panagou' talk

**Title**: Control synthesis for safety- and time-critical systems under uncertainty

**Abstract**: Fully autonomous operation of robots in unstructured and unknown environments has been an ongoing area of research. Despite significant progress over the years, there are still open challenges due to constraints (e.g., safety and time specifications, computational power), malicious or faulty information, and environmental uncertainty. This talk will present some of our recent results and ongoing work on spatiotemporal control under constraints and uncertainty. The proposed framework on Control Barrier Functions and Fixed-Time Control Lyapunov Functions aims to develop and integrate estimation, learning and control methods towards provably-correct and computationally-efficient mission synthesis for constrained and uncertain multi-agent systems.


### Prof Melanie Zeilinger's talk

**Title**: Safe learning-based control using a Model Predictive Control framework

**Abstract**: Model predictive control (MPC) is an established technique for addressing constraint satisfaction with demonstrated success in various industries. However, it requires a sufficiently descriptive system model as well as a suitable formulation of the control objective to provide the desired guarantees and solve the problem via numerical optimization. In this talk, I will present different options how learning and MPC can be combined to overcome some of the individual difficulties of both MPC and available reinforcement learning methods. I will in particular discuss learning for inferring a parametric model of the system dynamics, or for designing the objective in MPC, as well as the use of MPC as a safety filter, providing a modular approach for augmenting high-performance learning-based controllers with constraint satisfaction properties.
