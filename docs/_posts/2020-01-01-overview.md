Robot and automation systems are expected to carry out increasingly sophisticated tasks in complex environments. This places stringent expectations on their autonomy stack to enforce operational constraints and safety guarantees. Safe control synthesis methods, including model predictive control, reachability analysis, and control barrier functions, commonly rely on explicit mathematical definitions of safety constraints with known system and environment models. Nevertheless, many current applications incorporate perception uncertainty or semantic concepts in the task specifications, and safety requirements may be specified implicitly, abstractly, or incompletely.
