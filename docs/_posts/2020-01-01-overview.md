Guaranteeing safety is crucial for the effective deployment of robots. Control theory research has established techniques with theoretical safety and stability guarantees based on model predictive control, reference governor design, Hamilton-Jacobi reachability, control Lyapunov and barrier functions, and contraction theory. Similarly, formal methods techniques based on SMT solvers and hybrid system verification have been used to guarantee safety in systems. Existing techniques, however, predominantly assume that the robot motion dynamics and safety constraints are precisely known in advance. This assumption cannot be satisfied in the unstructured and dynamic real-world conditions. For example, an aerial vehicle aiding in disaster response must operate in an unpredictable environment subject to extreme disturbances. Similarly, a walking robot providing last-mile delivery has to traverse changing terrain while negotiating pedestrian traffic.

With recent progress in machine learning we can learn robot dynamics or environment models from sensory data. Gaussian Process regression and Koopman Operator theory have shown promise in estimating robot dynamics models. Deep neural network models have enabled impressive results in 3D reconstruction from visual data. Although empirically impressive, these machine learning techniques, however, do not provide guarantees for safety.

This workshop seeks to bring together experts from multiple communities -- robotics, control theory and machine learning -- and highlight the cutting-edge research in their intersection. We will feature talks from both the fields with an emphasis on safe robot control in uncertain environments.
