Guaranteeing safety together with controlling the dynamical systems for achieving complex tasks has emerged as a significant field to be focused for realizing advanced autonomous robotic systems. While numerous contributions for such safety control have been developed via model-based methods in terms of worst-case analysis or probabilistic guarantees, a perfect knowledge of the dynamics and environment is hardly available in practice. Recent advancement in machine learning and data-driven methods for controls has enhanced the prospect for enabling the operation of robotic systems within admissible state space under uncertain dynamics and environment, which is of vital importance for safety-critical systems including autonomous driving/flight and robotic surgery. 

This workshop seeks to address novel achievements and technical challenges arising in safety control under the uncertainties of dynamics and environment. The workshop features talks from communities in machine learning and control systems with an emphasis on robotic applications, for the sake of promoting interdisciplinary research from different perspectives. The technical approaches covered in the workshop are potentially, but not limited to, the following topics: 

- Control Barrier Function
- Reachability Analysis
- Model Predictive Control
- Reference Governor
- Contraction Theory
