Guaranteeing safety and stability is crucial for effective deployment of robots. Research in control theory has enabled techniques with theoretical guarantees based on model predictive control, reference governor design, Hamilton-Jacobi reachability, control Lyapunov and barrier functions, and contraction theory. Existing techniques, however, predominantly assume that task safety constraints and robot motion dynamics are known, which is untenable in unstructured and dynamic real-world environments. An aerial vehicle aiding in disaster response has to operate in an unpredictable environment, subject to extreme disturbances. Similarly, a walking robot providing last-mile delivery has to traverse changing terrains and negotiate with pedestrian traffic.

With recent progress in machine learning we can learn robot dynamics or environment models from sensory data. Gaussian Process regression and Koopman Operator theory have shown promise in estimating robot dynamics models. Deep neural network models have enabled impressive results in 3D reconstruction from visual data. Although empirically impressive, these machine learning techniques, however, do not provide guarantees for safety.

This workshop seeks to bring together experts from two communities -- safe robot control and model-based learning -- and highlight the cutting-edge research in their intersection. We will feature talks from both the fields with an emphasis on safe robot control in uncertain environments.
